# CK's Movie List

## Overview
My own list of "must watch before you die" movies. The list gets updated from time to time. My main intention to create such list was and still is to provide a solid "must watch before you die" overview of movies that I think are _gold_.


The list is alphabetical sorted but I do not say movie X is better than Y because it's simply hard or almost impossible to rate specific art over another one because there are a lot of variables to consider like the genre itself, the budget as well as the script and how many time someone had to create the movie.

### Are you a movie reviewer or somehow involved into movie making?

**No**, I'm not a professional reviewer nor do I get paid here to "advertise" any movie. I do it because I like quality movies and I wanted to share my experience. After watching movies for over 40 years now I still not consider me as _expert_ because I like to keep my point of view (_if possible_) objective and critical when I give my own personal review about a movie.


### What do you classify as good movie?

A good movie (for me) has some key points like:
* A good Story/Script
* A nice plot
* A nice twist
* Good Actors who fit into the role/character
* Good Music and sound effects
* Graphics as well as solid and fitting animations (depends if it's an animated movie or not and if there is C.G.I or not)
* A good movie does not need lots or C.G.I. at all there are good examples like the Alien movies with (_almost_) no C.G.I. in it.
* The movie should inspire me or open my mind which means that I think over the movie/story/characters after I watched it. I do not like brainless movies which I forgot the moment after I watched it.


### Do you have a all time fav movie?

A stated above that it's almost impossible to say or rate one movie above another one because the variables, but if I would give an honest answer I would say:
* [Lawrence of Arabia (1962)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056172/)


**Why this particually movie (?) is the big question (_without spoiling the movie_).**

First of all it was the first movie which I watched in my life, I watched it with my Dad ( â€  ) together.

Another reason is that I appreciate the art in the movie itself. For most people the movie seems compared to modern standards - _boring_ (_it's not_) because there are no C.G.I in it - but let me tell you that this movie is ground breaking in many ways because it lead the way to modern movies and motivated & inspired well-known regisseurs like [Spielberg](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg).

I watched the movie like 35 times (_maybe even more_) whenever I'm sad or around Christmas. And each time I watch it I find new details or camera shots which I did not noticed before. The art how they created the entire movie is outstanding and the depth of details as well as the execution and script gives me every single times goosebumps.

**Do you have a fav animated movie?**

I would say [Toy Story (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/).

The movie had an significant impact on my life. It woke my interest into [demo making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxjcU9x-nAw), graphics & and computer science in general.

This movie is interesting because of many aspects. It was the first blockbuster full animated movie ever and every frame took several hours or even days to produce.


### Why do you rewatch movies and is it worth it?

**Yes**, it's worth to rewatch movies.

You will find new details or you might understand the entire story/background better. Think of it like something to eat, as little kid you did not eat broccoli but later when you're and adult you might enjoy it because your taste changes over time, similar thing can be said about movies, you maybe change you mind give it a try and rewatch it and then you suddenly noticed: "Hey, I like it!". Because you totally forgot the movie or you are now capable o fully understand every aspect about the movie.


### Do you have a fav movie genre, or how you rate specific genres?

**Yes**, here is the order:
* __**Horror**__ (_but I do not like splatter films because they look often "cheap"_)
* Psycho
* Science Fiction/Fantasy
* Mystery
* Time Travel
* Crime
* History
* Thriller
* Drama
* Erotic
